# warsawjs-workshop-8-social-network

This (very) simple application was made to get familiar with some 
concepts of [esdf](https://github.com/rkaw92/esdf) framework. It
was developed during [warsaw.js](http://warsawjs.com/) workshop #8.

### note
_It was meant to be simpler than [the reference implementation](https://github.com/rkaw92/warsawjs-workshop-8-social-network)
in a way that it doesn't use any custom DI containers and all the 
important stuff takes place in a main file._
